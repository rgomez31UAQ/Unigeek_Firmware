## Building

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), then run:

```bash
# Build
pio run -e m5stickcplus_11
pio run -e m5stickcplus_2
pio run -e t_lora_pager
pio run -e m5_cardputer
pio run -e m5_cardputer_adv
pio run -e t_display_16mb

## Navigation

Navigation varies by device:

| Action | M5StickC (Default) | M5StickC (Encoder) | Cardputer / T-Lora Pager |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Up | AXP button | Rotate CCW | `;` key |
| Down | BTN\_B | Rotate CW | `.` key |
| Select | BTN\_A | Encoder press | `Enter` key |
| Back | — | BTN\_A (short press) | `Backspace` key |
| Left | — | AXP button | `,` key |
| Right | — | BTN\_B | `/` key |

On M5StickC, hold BTN\_A for 3 seconds to reset navigation mode to Default.

## Storage

Files are stored under `/unigeek/` on either SD card or LittleFS (fallback):

```
/unigeek/config                    device configuration
/unigeek/keyboard/duckyscript/     Ducky Script files (.ds)
/unigeek/wifi/eapol/               WPA2 handshake captures (.pcap)
/unigeek/wifi/portals/             Portal templates for AP, Evil Twin, Karma (HTML/CSS/JS)
/unigeek/wifi/captives/            Captured credentials from Evil Twin / Karma / Rogue DNS
/unigeek/qrcode/                   QR code content files
/unigeek/utility/passwords/        Password wordlists for EAPOL brute force
/unigeek/utility/cctv/             CCTV Sniffer target IP lists
/unigeek/nfc/dictionaries/         MIFARE Classic key dictionary files
/unigeek/web/file_manager/         Web file manager HTML files
```

SD card is used when available. LittleFS is always present as a fallback.

## TODO

- LoRa
- nr24lf
- cc1101
- use HAS_PSRAM instead of t lora pager on ble scanning wardriving.
- use nimble for ble scanning for non psram device
- need way to mark file been uploaded (rename or get first line of file to know when it's uploaded. think which best, easier and low cost)
